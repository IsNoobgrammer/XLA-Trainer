## Overview
TPU-Trainer is a Python-based toolkit designed to simplify and optimize the process of training machine learning models on TPUs. It provides a collection of loss functions, training utilities, dataset abstractions, and attention mechanisms, all modular and extensible for easy integration into your ML workflows.

## Project Structure
- `data/` — Dataset classes and utilities (base, conversation, custom, pretrain)
- `losses/` — Loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy)
- `moneypatch_attention/` — Attention mechanisms and wrappers (flash, splash)
- `tests/` — Unit tests for datasets and attention modules
- `example_usage.py` — Example script demonstrating usage
- `Splash on TPU.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook for demonstration/experiments
- `docs/` — Documentation files
- `README.md` — Main project documentation
- `pytest.ini` — Pytest configuration

## Features
- Ready-to-use loss functions for common ML tasks
- Dataset abstractions for various data formats
- Advanced attention mechanisms for efficient training
- Utilities for efficient TPU training
- Modular design for easy extension
- Example scripts and Jupyter notebook
- Comprehensive unit tests

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd TPU-Trainer
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Explore the modules:**
   - The `data` directory contains dataset classes for different data types.
   - The `losses` directory contains loss functions such as cross-entropy.
   - The `moneypatch_attention` directory contains advanced attention mechanisms.
   - The `tests` directory contains unit tests for core modules.
   - The `example_usage.py` script and `Splash on TPU.ipynb` notebook provide usage examples.

## Example Usage
```python
from losses.cross_entropy import cross_entropy_loss

# Example: Using cross_entropy_loss in your training loop
loss = cross_entropy_loss(predictions, targets)
```

## Module Summaries

## Loss Functions
- **cross_entropy_loss**: Standard cross-entropy loss for classification tasks. See `losses/cross_entropy.py` for implementation details.
- More loss functions will be added in future releases.

## API Reference
- See [API.md](API.md) for detailed documentation of available modules and functions. (If this file is missing, API documentation will be added soon.)

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to contribute to this project. (If this file is missing, contribution guidelines will be added soon.)

## FAQ
**Q: What Python version is required?**
A: Python 3.7 or higher is recommended.

**Q: How do I run training on a TPU?**
A: Ensure you have access to a TPU environment (e.g., Google Colab, GCP). Follow the setup instructions and adapt your training script to use TPU-specific APIs as needed.
